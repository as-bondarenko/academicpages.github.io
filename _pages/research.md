Here, I describe some of my research with a bit of narrative and context.


## Synthetic light-harvesting complexes

<div style="width:100%;">
    <div style="float:left;width:30%;"><img src="../images/research_delocalization.png" /></div>
    <div style="float:none;"> We modeled large tubular aggregates of cyanine dyes, which are synthetic analogues of chlorosomes, and explained optical changes observed in their absorption spectra [<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.7b00967">J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2017</a>]. 

We expanded these findings into a systematic study of aggregate size effects on optical and electronic properties to get insights into design rules for molecular electronics [<a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0008688">J. Chem. Phys. 2020</a>]. 

In parallel, we went beyond phenomenological modeling by including atomistic information into the model: besides reproducing optical properties, the model allows us to unravel the microscopic origin of the photophysical properties of such aggregates [<a href="https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.12279956">Chemrxiv 2020</a>].  </div>

## Intermolecular energy transfer

<div style="width:100%;">
    <div style="float:left;width:30%;"><img src="../images/research_exciton_dynamics.png" /></div>
    <div style="float:none;"> Recently, we have comprehensively compared three computational models for energy transfer in multichromophoric complexes [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301010419305968">Chem. Phys. 2020</a>]. 

We compared the multichromophoric Forster resonance energy transfer (MC-FRET), 
the numerical integration of the Schrodinger equation (NISE), and the Haken-Strobl-Reineker (HSR) model, 
using as a reference the numerically exact Hierarchy of Equations of Motion (HEOM). 
We investigate their behavior in various system and parameter regimes, including the regime relevant to natural light-harvesting systems.

## Modeling of nonlinear spectroscopy

<div style="width:100%;">
    <div style="float:left;width:30%;"><img src="../images/modeling_2DIR_spectra.png" /></div>
    <div style="float:none;"> We developed a benchmark method to probe protein conformational changes based on two-dimensional infrared spectra [<a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4919716">J. Chem. Phys. 2015</a>, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00420">J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016</a>].

Two-dimensional modeling of infrared spectra also helped <a href="https://twitter.com/wojciechkopec3">Wojciech</a> unravel the microscopic mechanism behind the strict ion selectivity of potassium channels [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-018-0105-9">Nat. Chem. 2018</a>]. </div>
