I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Tempelaar Team](https://tempelaar.chem.northwestern.edu/),
part of the [Chemistry Department of Northwestern University](https://chemistry.northwestern.edu/).
Previously, I obtained my PhD followed by a short postdoctoral appointment working with
[Prof. Jasper Knoester](https://www.rug.nl/staff/j.knoester/) and 
[Prof. Thomas La Cour Jansen](https://www.rug.nl/staff/t.l.c.jansen/) 
at the [Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials](https://www.rug.nl/research/zernike/), 
[University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) (Netherlands). Before that, I have obtained
the MSc in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling 
([TCCM](https://www.emtccm.org/)) at the [University of Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/up/en) (Portugal).
