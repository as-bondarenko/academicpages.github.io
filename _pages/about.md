I am a postdoctoral fellow working with [Prof. Jasper Knoester](https://www.rug.nl/staff/j.knoester/) and [Dr. Thomas La Cour Jansen](https://www.rug.nl/staff/t.l.c.jansen/) at the [Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials](https://www.rug.nl/research/zernike/), [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) (Netherlands). Previously, I have obtained my PhD in the same group, after having obtained the MSc in Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modelling ([TCCM](https://www.emtccm.org/)) at the [University of Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/up/en).
